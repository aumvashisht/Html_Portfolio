<ol>
    <li><h3>Avengers Endgame</h3></li>
<p>It is my Favourite movie just because of the fact that I can watch it repeatedly on loop. It Also marked the end of 10 years of MCU.</p>
<li><h3>Oppenheimer</h3></li>
<p>My First Movie at an Imax Cinema. Also the combo of Cillian Murphy, RDJ and Nolan.</p>
<li><h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3></li>
<p>Watching 3 Spider-men on Cineman with the hype that it created so it deserves to be on the list.</p>
